# User Stories â€“ Airbnb Clone Backend

This directory contains user stories derived from the system's use case diagram. These stories help bridge the gap between the technical implementation and real user needs.

Each story reflects how users (Guests, Hosts, Admins) will interact with the system, based on core features like registration, property management, bookings, payments, and reviews.

See `user-stories.md` for the full list.
